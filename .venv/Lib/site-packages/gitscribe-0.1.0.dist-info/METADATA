# GitScribe

**History-driven documentation generator** — analyzes a local Git repository by reading its `.git` directory and commit history to produce accurate, history-aware project documentation.

Documentation is derived **strictly from Git data** (commits, diffs, branches, tags, and file evolution). Git history is the primary source of truth; the tool does not infer intent from source code alone.

## Features

- **Reconstructs project evolution** over time from version control
- **Identifies major phases**: architectural shifts, breaking changes, refactors
- **Produces documentation** that reflects what actually happened, not only what the code looks like today
- **CLI-only**, **offline**, **deterministic** — no GitHub or external APIs; no LLM inventing facts

## Installation

Requires Python 3.9+ and a local Git repository.

```bash
# From the project root
pip install -e .

# Or install dependency only (run with: python -m gitscribe.cli)
pip install GitPython>=3.1.40
```

## Usage

```bash
# Analyze current directory (must be a Git repo)
gitscribe

# Specify repository path
gitscribe /path/to/repo

# Write output to a specific directory
gitscribe -o ./docs

# Also generate SUMMARY.md (high-churn files and unstable components)
gitscribe --with-summary

# Limit commits analyzed (default 5000)
gitscribe --max-commits 2000

# Quiet mode
gitscribe -q
```

## Outputs (Markdown)

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **CHANGELOG.md** | Generated from tags, commit history, and detected breaking changes |
| **ARCHITECTURE.md** | Inferred module/directory structure and how it evolved over time |
| **DEVELOPMENT.md** | Timeline of major features, refactors, and technical decisions |
| **SUMMARY.md** | Optional; high-churn files and unstable components (use `--with-summary`) |

All files are written to the repository root (or `--output-dir`). They are suitable for real-world projects and emphasize **correctness** and **traceability** (commit SHAs, scopes, and dates).

## How it works

1. **Git reader** — Reads only the local `.git` directory (no network). Uses [GitPython](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython) to walk commits, tags, branches, and diffs.
2. **Analyzers** (deterministic):
   - **Breaking changes**: Message patterns (e.g. `BREAKING CHANGE`, `feat!:`), plus heuristics (e.g. very large deletions).
   - **Architecture**: File tree at key revisions (tags + sampled commits); top-level modules and notable structural changes.
   - **Timeline**: Event types (feature, refactor, fix, release, etc.) from commit message keywords and diff scope.
   - **Churn**: Per-file and per-directory commit counts and line deltas.
3. **Generators** — Turn analysis results into Markdown only; no LLM is used to invent content.

## Constraints

- **CLI only** — no graphical UI
- **Works offline** — no GitHub or other remote APIs
- **Deterministic** — LLMs may be used only to phrase findings, not to invent facts (this implementation uses no LLM)
